Here's an experiment with Google's latest video generation model ([Veo 3](https://gemini.google/overview/video-generation/)):

<video controls style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;">
  <source src="/assets/not-me-dancing.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

I took a top-half picture of myself, outpainted it to full-body via Nano Banana, then used that outpainted image and a prompt to seed an 8-second video.

<img src="/assets/profile-top-half.jpg" alt="Top-half photo before outpainting to full body" style="max-width: 350px; width: 100%;" />

The result is funny and mesmerizing, at least for me. Notice how my shirt folds when I move. The only two things that reveal this is fake: my unnaturally happy smile and those smooth moves.

I don't dance like that.
