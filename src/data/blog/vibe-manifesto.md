Yesterday, I published the [Vibe Coding Manifesto](https://vibemanifesto.org/).

I’ve had quite a few conversations about this with AI experts I respect - Jason Liu, Michał Warda, Łukasz Wróbel, Tomasz Gancarczyk, Maciej Cielecki - and new patterns in software development are emerging. Rather than a threat, I see this shift as an enabler of speed, experimentation, and systems thinking.

The term Vibe Coding comes from a tweet by Andrej Karpathy, where [he describes](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) a new way of working: letting go of the code itself, embracing AI tools, and focusing purely on intent. Instead of writing every line, you describe changes, accept suggestions, and keep things moving.

This manifesto is my attempt to capture what's happening - a small marker for this moment in time.

And I have a feeling this won’t stop at software development. We’ll see Vibe Marketing, Vibe Research, Vibe Medicine (!?) and other fields where humans set direction and agents do the heavy lifting.

Tune in, vibe, and reroll if needed. :)
