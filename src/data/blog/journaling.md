description: I have been journaling for 30 years.
---

This year marks 30 years since I started journaling. I still have my first diary - a present I received when I was fifteen, not sure from who. I’ve been writing a journal ever since, in various forms, with varying frequency, style, and, of course, varying skill. This is one of the most important habits I’ve developed - it helps me think clearly, express myself, introspect, understand others, but also just play with words, find the right tone, the rhythm, the flow. I can’t imagine being myself without covering all these thousands of pages with words, over all these years. Writing is very easy now - you can ask an LLM to write anything, and it will, skillfully. And yet, I feel that writing is a deeply human act - one that can show not only skill but also vulnerability, humility, or empathy. There are so many ways to express oneself in writing. We are all different, we are all beautiful, we are all great. I hope I will continue writing for many more years to come, with and without LLMs, expressing myself just like I did in 1995, on those first pages.
